# About me
Passionate about creating processes and tools to help individuals and companies reach their goals. Since 2009, I've had the opportunity to pursue this passion as a web developer working in a small shop, running a small business, and working in small to mid-sized companies. Early in my career I was a mix of a web developer/product owner/marketer and in the later half find myself specializing more as a frontend engineer with a eye for product and process development. 

# Career Goals
I'm looking to be apart of a forward-thinking organization who prides themselves on the quality of their products and services while maintaining a desire experiment with integration of new tools and processes that helps its teams achieve their goals.
