# About me
As an **entrepreneurial-minded web engineer** working in tech for the last 11 years, I focus heavily on increasing the effectiveness of communication within teams, business processes and codebases. I also specialize in creating custom solutions to integrate external applications (whether homemade or from a third-party platform) into client facing-applications - allowing operation managers to have more control over their application without code being the bottleneck.

## My Values 
### As an engineer
- Continues to practice increasing the speed and accuracy of translations between business logic and coding logic
- Automates as much of their own work as possible, opening a path for them to help others using the same value
- Maintaining a continuing awareness of the goals of those they're building for, as to ensure they build the right sets of products with minimal iterations

### As an entrepenuer
- Maintains an awareness of their user's experience and strives to increase the quality of their experience
- Focuses on adding or removing processes to better guide the business to it's desired outcome
- Use data to resolve major decision forks

### As a lead
- Continues to increase their capacity for empathy and compassion - especially during stress and strife - therefore they can accurately solve underlying problems
- Cares about increasing their own communication and listening skills, as to provide those they are guiding a reflection that assists them in breaking down their complex problems into bite-sized ones to resolve much more easily.
